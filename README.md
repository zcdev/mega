# Mega Millions

Thank you to Drew (https://www.iamdrewright.com), a talented designer friend who helped me with the UI design!

This was one of the very first array shuffle I've initially written when I started learning JavaScript. Years later, we decided to challenge the UI. I learned some HTML5 canvas techniques in this project.
